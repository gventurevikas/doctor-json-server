    "fullDescription": "This case study presents the successful treatment of a 45-year-old patient with severe degenerative disc disease who underwent complex spinal fusion surgery. The patient had been suffering from chronic back pain for over 5 years and had tried various conservative treatments without success.\n\n## Patient History\n\nThe patient, a 45-year-old office worker, presented with:\n- Severe lower back pain radiating to both legs\n- Difficulty walking and standing for extended periods\n- Failed conservative treatments including physical therapy and medications\n- MRI showing severe degenerative disc disease at L4-L5 and L5-S1 levels\n\n## Treatment Plan\n\nAfter thorough evaluation, Dr. Ankur Goswami recommended a two-level spinal fusion procedure using:\n- Minimally invasive techniques\n- Advanced instrumentation\n- Bone graft material for fusion\n- Post-operative rehabilitation program\n\n## Surgical Procedure\n\nThe surgery was performed using:\n- Small incisions (less than 2 inches each)\n- Advanced imaging guidance\n- Specialized surgical instruments\n- Minimally invasive approach to preserve muscle tissue\n\n## Results\n\nPost-surgery results:\n- Significant reduction in pain (90% improvement)\n- Improved mobility and function\n- Return to work within 8 weeks\n- No complications during or after surgery\n- Successful fusion confirmed on follow-up imaging\n\n## Follow-up\n\nThe patient continues to do well with:\n- Regular follow-up appointments\n- Continued physical therapy\n- Gradual return to normal activities\n- Excellent long-term outcomes",
